## Usage:
##
##	./gnu.sh 
##
## A utility to detect some essential utilities that may be non-GNU
## on this system. For Mac, it suggests to use brew to install the GNU
## variants of the utilities.
## 
## By default, it only checks find, sed, awk, grep and diff, which are
## the most common tools to use in bash scripting. For other utils, typically
## BSD utils are fairly similar to GNU. For a more complete override of all
## local utilities, you can either override UTILS as such:
##
## UTILS=$'utilname:brewpackage\nutil2name:util2package...etc' ./gnu.sh
##
## ... or simply use another utility that more completely tries to GNUify
## your environment.
##
## Specifiy BIN_DIR="" to set the BIN_DIR where to install the utils. It
## is added to the PATH while running the script, so you're not required to
## have it on your PATH to begin with. That way you don't need to install
## it on your global PATH, even though you obviously you still can.
